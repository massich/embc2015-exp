=========

This is a study of MRI data alignment in Prostate imaging.
Targeting EMBC 2015 conference

Thesis

The MRI data between patients is not aligned. Therefore normalizing, speriphing, etc. the data has makes no sense when the features are not aligned.

Goal
----

* Illustrate the problem
* Propose an alignment method
* try to calculate xxxxxx
